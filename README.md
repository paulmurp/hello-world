# hello-world
Intro to the world from Paul

Hello interested people!

My GitHub is where I store my recent projects as I re-awaken my coding skills with new technologies.

My private repositories are React (usually MERN) based though you may see the odd Unix scripting project or two.

Feel free to ping me with coding questions, requests for enhanements, job offers, donations and conversation starters.

Yours in Coding
Paul
